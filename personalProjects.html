                            This project started in January 2019, when I was very enthuisastic about the video game "League of Legends".
                            In case you don't know what this game is about, League of Legends is a 5v5 multiplayer online game.
                            The "minimap" is on the bottom of a player's screen, it provides a lot of macro-information about what the player's teammates and opponents are doing.
                            Therefore, it is really important to look at the minimap once in a while, but a lot of players often forget.
                            So I thought, can I create an AI that constantly keeps track of the minimap, and summarize the information for me?

                        <p>
                            I wanted to extract information from the game without hacking the server, which will get me banned.
                            My idea was to use image recognition, I want an AI to recognize the avatars on the screen and keep track of where my enemies are.
                            My pipeline begins with a image processing algorithm that extracts the avatars from the minimap image. 
                            Then individually, the avatar images are passed to a image classification network which will label the avatars, and we know what enemy is where on the map.

                            I detailed my approach in two posts on CSDN (in Chinese):

                        <h2 id="Arc_Channel_pelvis_fixation_path_algorithms_section">Rubik's Cube Scanner + Solver</h2>
                        
                        
                        <p>
                            Rubik's cubes is one of my hobbies. In winter 2018, I wanted to make a program that can solve rubik's cube for those who do not know how.
                            Fun fact, the maximum minimunm number of steps needed to solve any rubik's cube configuration is called <a href="https://www.cube20.org/">"God's Number"</a>.
                            It was only recently proven that God's number is 20, and it has only been proven by solving every 46 quintillion configurations of the rubik's cube using a computer.
                            At the time, there were already plenty of programs that can solve rubik's cubes, but the user have to enter the color of every face of the cube, which is tiring.
                            So I thought, wouldn't it be nice if my program can scan the facets of the rubik's cube using the webcam, and then solve it for the user?
                            

                            <center>

                                <p>Demo of my rubik's cube scanner + solver.</p>
                            </center>

                            My program is actively scanning for rubik's cubes in the webcam image, and when it recognizes one, it will read the colors and automatically enter them into the solver.
                            The solver then finds the solution and displays an animation of how to solve the cube.

                            My source codes are accessible at <a href="https://github.com/dcheng728/Rubik-s-Cube-Scanner-Solver">github</a>, and I wrote a post about this program (in Chinese) at <a href="https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_42488182/article/details/103451877?spm=1001.2014.3001.5501">CSDN</a>.

                        <h2 id="soft_robotics_section">Rock Paper Scissors Machine</h2>
                        <p>
                            Now days, computers are just beating humans at everythings, chess, GO, even DOTA2. 
                            How about Rock Paper Scissors? 
                            The optimal strategy to play Rock Paper Scissors is indeed play randomly, can humans' faith be restored in this classic game?
                            The answer is NO. In the spring of 2020, I gained access to a <a href="https://www.ultraleap.com/product/leap-motion-controller/">Leap Motion Controller</a>, tool
                            that can be used to track hand motions. 
                            I gathered enough data to train a neural network that would recognize the three gestures of Rock Paper Scissors, and used it to play against others. 

                            <center>
                                <img src="media/rps demo.gif" width="700"  />
                                <p>Demo of the computer rock paper scissors player.</p>
                            </center>

                            The program is not actually "predicting" what the human will play next, it is classifying the human's hand motion into one of the three categories, then reacting very quickly.
                            So technically, the computer is cheating, but does that mean faith in humanity can be restored?
