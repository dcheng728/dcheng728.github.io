                            This project started in January 2019, when I was very enthuisastic about the video game "League of Legends".
                            In case you don't know what this game is about, League of Legends is a 5v5 multiplayer online game.
                            The "minimap" is on the bottom of a player's screen, it provides a lot of macro-information about what the player's teammates and opponents are doing.
                            Therefore, it is really important to look at the minimap once in a while, but a lot of players often forget.
                            So I thought, can I create an AI that constantly keeps track of the minimap, and summarize the information for me?

                            Pelvis fracture typically happen after traumatic injuries such as automobile accidents. This fracture is a serious injury with disability rate of 60% and death rate of 10%. 
                            In order to put the fractured pelvis back together, a screw need to fixate the pelvis. 
                            Due to the complex and irregular geometry of the human pelvis, a path for a straight screw is not ideal. 
                            In the summer of 2021, I worked on designing an algorithm that finds a curved path to put a fixation screw in the pelvis. 
                            We took a finite element approach to this problem where we approximated the pelvis' geometric structure to many tiny voxels, then generated constant-curvature paths that would fixate the fractured bone. 
                            The finite element approach allows our algorithm choose a tradeoff between efficiency and being realistic by adjusting the voxel size. 
                            We later performed computational biomechanics analysis to analyze the constant-curvature paths we generated, and the results indicate a higher safety measure than traditional straight paths.

                            When most people think about robots, they picture a rigid humanoid built with metals.
                            Traditionally, robotics have been built with rigid materials for durability and precision. 
                            However, there are tasks that we wish a robotic system can be "soft".
                            For example, when a robot needs to interact with humans or handle delicate objects. 
                            At Beihang University between June 2018 and August 2021, I participated in several projects in design and innervation of soft robotics.

                                    <p>With another PhD student, we designed a soft robotic finger with three degrees of freedom that can mimick the full range of motion of that of a finger.
                                        The finger is 3D printed using nylon with notches carved into it. The notches are arranged in a specific way that it only allows joint-like rotation rather than shrinkage or elongation in the axial direction.

                                        <p>This soft finger proposal has been applied onto both robotic grippers and prosthetic hands.
                                            The benefit of using soft fingers on hands is that the soft material is compliant in nature, so it can adapt to the surface geometry of the object it

                                    <p>Soft robotics are superior to rigid robotics in compliance and adaptability, but this comes with the price of much harder kinematic modeling and sensorization.
                                        Innervation means "to give something the ability to sense". For traditional rigid robots, the robot's movement in response to actuation is much more predictable: most can be modeled using classical physics or trignometric equations.
                                        However, for soft robotics, a lot of times we don't know how it will behave, and this makes innervating soft robotics a persistent challenge in the soft robotics community.
                                        We came up with a biomimetic design to allow soft manipulators to sense. 
                                        The proprioception framework in human body is how we feel where our body parts are at and how heavy things are, when someone is trying to stand on one foot with their eyes closed, they are using their proprioception. 
                                        We applied this mechanism to soft robotics, and by using machine learning algorithms, we were able to distinguish 8 different textures with a soft robotic finger.

                            Naturally, consumers with different sensitivities towards prices exist in a market. 
                            Firms may choose to take advantage of such varying price sensitivity to maximize profit. 
                            This practice is called price discrimination or personalized pricing. 
                            Apple Inc. is considered by many to have changed the personalized computer and phone industry, it is also once the world’s largest company with market capitalization in the trillions. 
                            The iPhone is a popular product from Apple sold across the globe. 
                            In fact, the prices of iPhones vary in an interesting fashion across different markets. 
                            For example, the iPhone 13 with 128gb of storage is sold at $799 in the U.S. and roughly $1441 in Brazil, a much less developed economy. 
                            Selling iPhones in Brazil definitely requires additional costs that may otherwise be avoided in the U.S. But when those additional costs are accounted for, are iPhones still price higher in countries such as Brazil than in the U.S?
                            
                            <br>

                            I was interested in finding out whether geo-economical factors affect the price of iPhones in different countries when differentiated costs are accounted for.
                            In my work, I adopted Stigler's definition for price discrimination, gathered price of iPhones and socioeconomical data from 53 countries where Apple Inc. sell their products, and performed econometric analysis.
                            I found strong statistical evidence of Apple utilizing its market power to increase profit. Specifically, iPhones are <br>
