There are 3 experimental probes of elementary particle interactions: bound states, decays, scattering.

# decaying
- We can not hope to calculate the lifetime of any particular particle, rather, we calculate the mean lifetime $\tau$ of a bunch of particles. The critical parameter, then, is the **decay rate** $\Gamma$, the probability per unit time that any muon will decay, for example.  
- A short derivation finds the mean lifetime $\tau$ is $\tau = \frac{1}{\Gamma}$
- The **branching ratio** is the fraction of all particles of a given type that decay by each mode.
- For decays, the essential problem is to calculate the decay rate $\Gamma$, then it would be easy to compute everything else

# Scattering
- The parameter of interest is the cross-sectional $\sigma$
- **resonance**: a special energy at which the particles involved 'like' to interact, forming a short-lived semibound state before breaking apart. resonance produces bumps in the graph of $\sigma$ v.s. $E$. 

# The golden rule
- the amplitude contains all the **dynamical** information, we calculate it by evaluating the feynman diagrams.
- the phase space factors contains only the **kinematical** information, it depends on the masses, energies, and momenta of the participant. 
- The transition rate for a given process is determined by the amplitude and phase space according to **Fermi's golden rule**:
$$\text{transition rate} = \frac{2\pi}{\hbar}|\mathscr{M}|^2\times (\text{phase space})$$
