- bound states are made significant by quark model
- perturbation theory was made to handle scattering and decaying, dont handle bound states well
- relativistic $\approx$ kinetic energy >> $mc^2$ or binding energy >> $mc^2$
- schro are treated as axioms in QM

# hydrogen atom
- radial schro picks up an effective potential
$$V(r) \rightarrow V(r) + \frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{l(l+1)}{r^2}$$
just like in CM
- **relativistic** correction together with **spin-orbit** coupling to form **fine structure** because they are both $O(\alpha^4)$
- **lambshift**: splits 2s, 2p, $O(\alpha^5)$
- **hyperfine**: spin-spin coupling via magnetic dipole, $O(\alpha^4)$
- **quarkoniums** are difficult to deal with because 
	1. strong force is involved, whose potential we dont know
	2. light quarks (u,d,s) are intrinsically relativistic

# light quark mesons
- within a multiplet, the particle with the higher charge is assigned the greater $I_3$
- $\pi^0$ is neither $u\bar{u}$ nor $d\bar{d}$, but the $I_3= 0$ state of the isospin triplet
$$\text{isospin triplet} = \begin{cases} 
|11> = -u\bar{u}\\
|10> = (u\bar{u} - d\bar{d})/\sqrt{2} \\
|1-1> = d \bar{u}
\end{cases}$$
- $\eta' = (u\bar{u} + d\bar{d} + s\bar{s})/\sqrt{3}$ is unaffected under SU(3) in the same sense that $\pi^0$ is an singlet under isospin SU(2)
- light quarks (u,d,s) belong to the fundamental rep. of SU(3), their antiquarks belong to the conjugate rep. of SU(3): $3 \otimes \bar{3} = 8 \oplus 1$ 
- the fact that quarks have unequal masses breaks mass symmetry in quark multilets
# heavy quark baryons
- non-relativistic due to large mass
- 3 body systems, complicates things
- most similar to helium in theories we have already studied

- the 3-body difficulty is alleviated by considering $l=0$ states, where angular momentum of entire system comes from only coupling of the spins. This gives a j=3/2 quartet (totally symmetric), and two j=1/2 doublets (both antisymmetric among two particles): $2\otimes 2 \otimes 2 = 4 \oplus 2 \oplus 1$
- pauli's exclusion principle dictates which flavor states are allowed to couple with which color, spin, space state. The total spin of baryon being 3/2 or 1/2 implies the entire state must be totally antisymmetric. 
- 3 light quarks in 3 flavors yields 1 decuplet, 2 octets, and a singlet: $3 \otimes 3 \otimes = 10 \oplus 8 \oplus 8 \oplus 1$
- every naturally occuring particle is a color singlet. Baryons have 3 particles with color, there is only 1 singlet, so **that singlet must be the one baryons occupy**: 
$$\psi(\text{color}) = (rgb-rbg + gbr - grb + brg - bgr)/\sqrt{6}$$
- Since a baryon is antisymmetric, its color being singlet means the rest of its wavefunction is symmetric
- natural occuring particles are color singlets because suppose it's a colorless non singlet then a SU(3) color transformation can give it a color
