- method of images is concerned with N point charges in presence of boundary surfaces, i.e. conductors at certain potentials
- the image charge must lie external to field of interest

# 2.2 
- the charge density on a surface is the normal derivative of $\Phi$ on the surface
- force in mirror image configuration can be calculated by taking mirror charges into consideration directly. 



# GREEN FUNCTION
- a green function is uniquely specified once geometry and type of boundary condition is specified
- green function has a part that satisfies laplace and a part satisfy poisson
