Transition from quantum mechanical to classical

CM partition function:

$$Q_N = \frac{1}{N! h^{3N}} \int d\omega e^{\beta H(p,q)}$$

where $d\omega = d^{3N}p d^{3N}q$

QM partition function: 
$$Q_N = \int_0^\infty e^{\beta E} g(E) dE$$

- An ensemble of systems contain a copy for each microstate of the system
- Each system in the ensemble satisfies all external requirements placed on the original system and in this sense is 'just as good' as the actual system
- the fundamental postulate gives equal probability to each system in the ensemble

Microcanonical Ensemble: $\Omega = \Omega(N,V,E)$
Canonical Ensemble: $\Omega = \Omega(N,V,T)$

In canonical ensemble, $\textbf{Prob}(r) = \frac{e^{-\beta E_r}}{\sum_i e^{-\beta E_i}}$. This result can be obtained in two ways: 1. system in thermal equilibrium with large heat reservoir, 2. ensemble approach, then find most probable macrostate via lagrange multipliers.
