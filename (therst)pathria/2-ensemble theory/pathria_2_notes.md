Microcanonical ensemble: macrostates defined by (N,V,E)

- The ensemble average of any physical quantity is identical to the value one expects to obtain on measurement

- The volume $\omega = \int d^{3N}p d^{3N}q$ integrated over allowed region is the volume of allowed region in phase space, give direct measure of multiplicity of states

=> we are led to define $\omega_0$ as volume of single state in phase space
=> $\omega_0 \equiv O(\hbar^N)$
