# formulation of the problem
- system in equilibrium when potential is at extremum, if the extremum is minimum then the equilibrium is stable. 
- we are interested in the motion of the system within the immediate neighborhood of stable equilibria, giving bound states
- by equilibrium condition and shifting the zero of potential, the potential can be written purely quadratically for small displacements in any system upto O(2).

# simple derivation for soln of SHO
- assuming small displacements about stable equilibrium => generalized coordinates $\eta_i = q_i - q_{0i}$, the most general lagrangian is $$L = \frac{1}{2}[T_{ij} \dot{\eta}^i \dot{\eta}^j - V_{ij} \eta^i \eta^j]$$ giving EQM $T_{ij}\ddot{\eta}_j + V_{ij}\eta_j = 0$
- With ansatz $\eta_i = C a_i e^{-i\omega t}$, the EQM becomes $$[V_{ij}-\omega^2T_{ij}]a^{j} = 0$$.
This demands the matrix $[V_{ij}-\omega^2T_{ij}]$ be singular, and we wish to solve for possible $\omega$ s that makes this matrix singular, the normal frequencies. 

# 6.3
- the lengthy arguments in 6.2 demonstratest that the eqm of small displacements ($\eta_i$) can be solved by the ansats 
$$\eta_i = Ca_ie^{-i\omega t}$$
a complete solution is a superposition of allowed frequencies
- the soln. of the secular equations are called resonant frequencies of the system.
