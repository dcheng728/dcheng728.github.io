## Obtaining the Hami
- in general, not any simpler. Can be simplified for special cases that overlap with physical interest
$$H = \dot{q}_i p_i - L$$
$$p_i = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_i}$$

- cyclic coordinates $q_j$ does not appear in Lagr as a non-derivative term, they give conserved momenta:

$$p_j = \frac{\partial L }{\partial q_j}$$

$$\dot{p}_j = \frac{\partial L }{\partial q_j} = 0$$

- If $t$ does not appear in $L$, then $H$ will be a constant of motion.
