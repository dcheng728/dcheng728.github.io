- the relative energy of two particles about their COM is 
$$T' = \frac{1}{2}m_1 \vec{r}_1^2 + \frac{1}{2}m_2\vec{r}^2_2,$$
where $\vec{r}_1, \vec{r}_2$ are polar vectors to the COM. Goldstein shows
$$T' = \frac{1}{2}\frac{m_1 m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \dot{\vec{r}}^2$$
where $\vec{r}$ is the separation between particle 1 and particle 2.

- for 2 bodies under central force, examining the magnitude of the radial vector only gives a 1D problem. The fictitious centrifugal force is introduced: $f \rightarrow d' + \frac{l^2}{mr^3} \approx V \rightarrow V' = V + \frac{1}{2}\frac{l^2}{2mr^2}$

## goldstein 3.4
- by considering $G = \sum_i \vec{p}_i \cdot \vec{r}_i$, and taking time average, we arrive at
$$<T> = -\frac{1}{2}<\sum_i \vec{F}_i \cdot \vec{r}_i>$$
this is the **virial theorem**
- goldstein claims that the virial theorem can be used to argue the **ideal gas law**

# 3.5 the differential equation for the orbit and integrable power-law potentials
- $l dt = mr^2 d\theta \Rightarrow \frac{d}{dt} = \frac{l}{mr^2}\frac{d}{d\theta}$ 
- [ ] make sense of the equation above, in terms of the differentials
- goldstein argues that if $\theta$ satisfies the eqm, $-\theta$ does as well
- not every power of $r$ in $V = ar^{n+1}$ can be solved by integration. Only for $n=1,-2,-3$ have trig solns. For $n=5,3,0,-4,-5,-7$ have elliptic soln. 

# 3.7
- $$\theta = \theta' - \arccos \left[\frac{\frac{l^2 u}{mk}-1}{\sqrt{1+\frac{2El^2}{mk^2}}} \right]$$
- finds eqm for inverse square central force
- for elliptic orbits the major axis depends solely upon the energy, this is argued by solving a quadratic formula
- eccentricity (semiminor axis) governed by angular momentum
- [ ] eccentricity
