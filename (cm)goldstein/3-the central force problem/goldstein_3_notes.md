- the relative energy of two particles about their COM is 
$$T' = \frac{1}{2}m_1 \vec{r}_1^2 + \frac{1}{2}m_2\vec{r}^2_2,$$
where $\vec{r}_1, \vec{r}_2$ are polar vectors to the COM. Goldstein shows
$$T' = \frac{1}{2}\frac{m_1 m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \dot{\vec{r}}^2$$
where $\vec{r}$ is the separation between particle 1 and particle 2.

- for 2 bodies under central force, examining the magnitude of the radial vector only gives a 1D problem. The fictitious centrifugal force is introduced: $f \rightarrow d' + \frac{l^2}{mr^3} \approx V \rightarrow V' = V + \frac{1}{2}\frac{l^2}{2mr^2}$

## goldstein 3.4
- by considering $G = \sum_i \vec{p}_i \cdot \vec{r}_i$, and taking time average, we arrive at
$$<T> = -\frac{1}{2}<\sum_i \vec{F}_i \cdot \vec{r}_i>$$
this is the **virial theorem**
- goldstein claims that the virial theorem can be used to argue the **ideal gas law**
