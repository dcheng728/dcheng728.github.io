# Hamilton Jacobi eq

Demand that from the canonical transformation $K(P,Q) = 0$, together assuming $F_2$ type generating function, then we have

$$H(q_i; \frac{\partial F_2}{\partial q_i}; t) + \frac{\partial F_2}{\partial t} = 0$$

The equation is the **Hamilton-Jacobi eq**. 

Write $S = S(qi; \alpha_i; t)$ as solution for $F_2$, where $\alpha$ are constants of integration. Then take $\alpha_i$ as momentum $P_i$, we have from generating function properties

$$p_i = \frac{\partial S}{\partial q_i}, \quad Q_i = \frac{\partial S}{\partial P_i} = \frac{\partial S}{\partial \alpha_i} \equiv \beta_i$$

Then we have parameterization

$$q_j = q_j(\alpha, \beta, t)$$

Hamilton's principal function is the generator of a canonical trans. to constant coordinates and momenta?
