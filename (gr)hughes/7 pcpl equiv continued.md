- When we have gravity, we can not cover all of spacetime with 1 inertial frame
    - => gravitational redshift exist, experimental fact

- einstein's insight is that the next best thing behind a global inertial frame is a free falling frame (FFF)

- all objects in a free falling frame, observe no relative acceleration

- we can match $g_{\alpha \beta}$ with $\eta_{\alpha \beta}$ in some frame up to $O(\delta x^2)$

- Prelude: how do we compare vectors at different points in spacetime? We must have a way of transporting a vector to the point of the other vector, then compare. Otherwise it does not make sense
