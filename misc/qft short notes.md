Only short notes and extremely short derivations here!

$$H = \frac{1}{2}\frac{p^2}{m} + \frac{1}{2}m\omega^2 x^2$$

$$[x,p] = i \quad a \approx \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x+ip) \quad a^\dagger \approx \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x-ip)$$

$$H = \omega(a^\dagger a + 1/2)$$

$$i\frac{d}{dt}a = [H,a] = \omega a \quad i\frac{d}{dt}a^\dagger = [H,a^\dagger] = -\omega a^\dagger$$

$$\delta(p-k) = (2\pi) \delta(2\pi p - 2\pi k)$$

$$[a,a^\dagger] = 1$$

$$[a_k, a^\dagger_p] = (2\pi)^3 \delta^3(\vec{p}-\vec{k}) \Rightarrow \int \frac{d^3k}{(2\pi)^3}[a_k,a^\dagger_p] = 1$$

$$a^\dagger_p |0> = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\omega_p}} |\vec{p}>$$

$$1 = \int \frac{d^3 p }{(2 \pi)^3} \frac{1}{2 \omega_p} |\vec{p}> < \vec{p}|$$

$$[\phi_x, \phi_y] = 0 $$

$$[\phi_x, \pi_y] = i \delta^3(\vec{x}-\vec{y}), \pi = \partial_t \phi_x|_{t=0}$$

Green's functions are solutions to linear DEs, such as laplacian, d'alembertian, because they are solutions to the free eqm, they are also called propagators.
