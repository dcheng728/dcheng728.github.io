- free electron model fails to disitinguish metals, semimetals, semiconductors, insulators; positive hall coeff. etc. 
- energy bands/gaps: gaps in spectrum where no electron is permitted
- explanation of bands require periodicity potential to be taken into account
# nearly free electron model
- treat periodic potential as perturbation
- bragg reflection occurs for waves in crystals, electorns are waves so can reflect braggly, giving gaps
# bloch functions
- **bloch functions:** solutions of the schro for a periodic potential must be of form
$$\psi_\vec{k} (\vec{r}) = u_{\vec{k}} (\vec{r}) \exp{i \vec{k} \cdot \vec{r}}$$ I think griffiths does this derivation as well
- bloch functions can be decomposed into a sum of traveling waves
