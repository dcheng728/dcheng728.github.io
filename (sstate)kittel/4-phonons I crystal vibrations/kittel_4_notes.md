- when a wave propagates in a crystal, we model it with entire planes of atoms moving in phase with displacements either parallel or perpendicular to wave vector (longitudinal/transverse)

- the author builds a model using hook's law assuming contributions from planes after the most two closest planes vanish, then solved as a coupled oscillator. The dispersion relation is then obtained

- only the elastic waves in the first brillouin zone are physically significant, for those outside such can be lattice-transformed into the first brillouin zone. 

- at the boundaries of the first brillouin zone, the solution to the wave is not traveling, i.e. standing. Recall that for refraction the boundaries on the first brillouin zone give the only wavevectors that can refract. 

- zero point energy $\approx$ GND state energy


- wave-like solutions do not exist for certain frequencies in polyatomic lattices.
for diatomic, this is between $\sqrt{2C/M_1}$ and $\sqrt{2C/M_2}$. There is a frequency gap at the boundary $K_{max} = \pm \frac{\pi}{a}$ of first brillouin zone.

TODO:
- [x] understand the connection between elastic waves, refraction, bragg law, first brillouin zone. 
When bragg condition is satisfied, traveling waves dont form, so we obtain standing waves that oscillate back and forth
