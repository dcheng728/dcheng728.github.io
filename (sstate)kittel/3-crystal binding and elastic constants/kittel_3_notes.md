- inert gas ~ noble gas ~ rare gas
# inert bonds
- ***van der waal potential ~ london potential ~ induced dip-dip potental***. It is the principal attractive interaction in inert gas. The othe major contribution to inert gas interactions is *pauli exclusive principle*, repulsive. These two forces add to give lennard jones.
- **lennard jones potential**: a combination of induced-dipole (or van der waal, or london) amd pauli exclusion principle
$$U(R) = 4 \epsilon [(\frac{\sigma}{R})^{12} - (\frac{\sigma}{R})^6]$$

- if we neglect the kinetic energy of the inert gas atoms, the cohesive energy of an inert gas crystal is given by summing the **lennard-jones** potential over all pairs of atoms in the crystal.
# ionic crystals
- the interaction of ionic crystals are largely coulomb, van der waal in ionic crystals only make contribute 1-2% in ionic crystals
- the name for electrostatic energy in ionic crystals is called **madelung energy**, because madelung was the first one to compute complicated sums over whole lattice of electrostatics
- the madelung constant is a sum of inverse of lattice separation over whole lattice, it decouples lattice structure in cohesive energy
- ionic bond examples: NaCl, CsCl
# covalent bonds
- covalent bonds consists of two antisymmetric electrons
- in metals, bonds are formed due to lowering of valence electron energy as compared with free atoms without bonding

- **hydrogen bonds**: an atom of H is attracted to 2 other atoms. h-bond is important for th einteraction between H2O molecules and is responsible together with the electrostatic attraction of edip for water and ice

- the elastic properties of a crystal is viewed by consideration of it as a continuous homogeneous medium, rather than a lattice. This is valid for elastic waves with $\lambda$ longer than E-6 cm or E12 Hz.
