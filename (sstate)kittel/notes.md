- ordinary optical refraction happens at 500A in crystals
- braggs diffraction (crystal diffraction) can be used to select a special spectrum of beam
- hydrogen bonds: an atom of H is attracted to 2 other atoms. h-bond is important for th einteraction between H2O molecules and is responsible together with the electrostatic attraction of edip for water and ice
- the elastic properties of a crystal is viewed by consideration of it as a continuous homogeneous medium, rather than a lattice. This is valid for elastic waves with $\lambda$ longer than E-6 cm or E12 Hz.

- in the fourer expansion of a function on the lattice, periodicity only allows terms with the same periodicity as the lattice in phase space. This defines the reciprocal lattice. Thus we can say the function is expanded on the reciprocal lattice in phase space:
$$n(x) = \sum_p n_p \exp{i \frac{2 \pi p}{a} x}$$
where $\frac{2 \pi p}{a}$ is a point in the reciprocal lattice, with dimension of inverse distance. 
- If $\vec{a}_1, \vec{a}_2, \vec{a}_3$ are primitive vectors of the crystal lattice, the primitive vectors of the reciprocal lattice $\vec{b}_1, \vec{b}_2, \vec{b}_3$ are give by 
$$\vec{b}_i = 2 \pi \frac{\vec{a}_j \times \vec{a}_k }{\vec{a}_i \cdot \vec{a}_j \times \vec{a}_k}$$
- the diffraction pattern of the crystal is a map of the reciprocal lattice
- by assuming refraction amplitude proportional to electron density, the total amplitude of the scattered wave in direction $k'$ from original wave in direction $k$ can be written as a function modulo the lattice with a function of the directions, such as below
$$n(\vec{r})dV \times \exp{[i(\vec{k} - \vec{k}') \cdot \vec{r}]}$$
scattering amplitude for crystal with $N$ cells can be written as 
$$F_G = N \int_{cell} dV n(\vec{r}) \exp{-i\vec{G} \cdot \vec{r}} = N s_G$$
where $s_G$ is the structure factor. 
- bcc and fcc are reciprocals of each other

-*van der waal potential ~ london potential ~ induced dip-dip potental*. It is the principal attractive interaction in inert gas. The othe major contribution to inert gas interactions is *pauli exclusive principle*, repulsive. These two forces add to give lennard jones.

- lennard jones potential: a combination of induced-dipole (or van der waal, or london) amd pauli exclusion principle
$$U(R) = 4 \epsilon [(\frac{\sigma}{R})^{12} - (\frac{\sigma}{R})^6]$$

- if we neglect the kinetic energy of the inert gas atoms, the cohesive energy of an inert gas crystal is given by summing the lennard-jones potential over all pairs of atoms in the crystal.
