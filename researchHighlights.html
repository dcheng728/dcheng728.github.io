                        Between October 2020 and June 2021, I looked for ways to reduce the dimensionality for grasp planning algorithms in order to decrease the search complexity. 
                        A grasp planning algorithm is one find a stable way to grasp an object given the object geometry and hand configurations.
                        The issue with grasp planning is that it is "complex" and it searches in high-dimensional space.
                        A typical human hand have over 20 degrees of freedom, plus 6 more for translation and rotation, the anthropomorphic grasp configuration space is nearly 30-dimensional.
                        In the past, researchers have reduced the complexity for finger configurations using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which preserves over 80% of finger variance with only three eigenvectors.
                        In my research, I looked for ways to reduce the complexity for searching for the hand transformation matrix.
