                    <h4>Grasp Planning Algorithms</h2>
                
                
                        <p>
                            Between October 2020 and June 2021, I looked for ways to reduce the dimensionality for grasp planning algorithms in order to decrease the search complexity. 
                            A grasp planning algorithm is one that finds stable ways to grasp an object given the object geometry.
                            The issue with grasp planning is that it searches a space with high dimensionality.
                            In the past, researchers have reduced the complexity for finger configurations using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which preserves over 80% of finger variance with only three eigenvectors.
                            In my research, I looked for ways to reduce the complexity of searching for the hand transformation matrix. 
                            I had two theories:
                            (1) the grasp space contain rotational symmetry, 
                            (2) there is a many-to-one mapping between object geometry and stable grasps; that is, the same grasp is stable for many different objects.  
                            Then I went on to conduct experiments with 60 everyday objects and 28 subjects, to see what ratio of the grasp space is needed for producing stable grasps.
                            Turns out, less than 1/4 of the space can account for over 95% of the 13860 grasps that I recorded, which supports my initial hypothesis that grasp planning can be done in a significantly reduced transformation search space.
                            In addition, my data shows the transformation parameters for human-planned grasps follow normal distribution.

                        <h4>Arc-Channel Pelvis Fixation Path Algorithms</h2>
                        
                        
                        <p>
                            Pelvis fracture typically happen after traumatic injuries such as automobile accidents. This fracture is a serious injury with disability rate of 60% and death rate of 10%. 
                            In order to put the fractured pelvis back together, a screw need to fixate the pelvis. 
                            Due to the complex and irregular geometry of the human pelvis, a path for a straight screw is not ideal. 
                            In the summer of 2021, I worked on designing an algorithm that finds a curved path to put a fixation screw in the pelvis. 
                            We took a finite element approach to this problem where we approximated the pelvis' geometric structure to many tiny voxels, then generated constant-curvature paths that would fixate the fractured bone. 
                            The finite element approach allows our algorithm choose a tradeoff between efficiency and being realistic by adjusting the voxel size. 
                            We later performed computational biomechanics analysis to analyze the constant-curvature paths we generated, and the results indicate a higher safety measure than traditional straight paths.
