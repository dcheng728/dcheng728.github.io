**fundamental assumption**: a closed system is equally likely to be in any of the quantum states accessible to it. By accessible, we mean 'compatible' with the physical description (temperature, volume, energy, pressure, etc.). This has nothing to do with which state the system will collapse to, but the number of states compatible (degeneracy) wich the state that the system collapses to. Usually this number is large.

- an ensemble is a collection of many systems, all constructed alike. Each system in the ensemble is a replica of the actual system in one of the quantum states accesible to the system. If there are g accessible states, then there will be g systems in the ensemble, one system for each state. 
*The concept of ensemble facilitates turning the fundamental assumption into mathematical language*.



- an ensemble of systems is composed of many systems, all constructed alike, each in one of the accessible states
- the probability distribution for state has an extremely sharp peak at the thermal equilibrium value suggests "most probable one" $\cong$ "the one"
